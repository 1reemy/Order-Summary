## Overview

This took me a while to complete but it was worth the time spent getting the order card to look like the template in the challenge. This is so as I have not used 
HTML and CSS in a while so my skills in those fields were pretty rusty. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Clearly see the various levels of text in the card element
- Easily identify the various elements of the Card

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

In order to arrive at a solution for the challenge, I examined the bare code that was given with the file and set about adding more html code to the template. In adding
code to the template, I started adding HTML code in order to give the page more structure and to seperate the various sections so that I can clearly position these sections
and style them using CSS. After doing this, I then styled the page based on how the example provided, looked. The image files provided were in SVG so I converted them to JPEG 
in doing this however, the hero image came out as a blue rectangle instead of displaying the full image. I was also unable to get the background image right.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to get some practice with HTML and CSS and also allowed me to learn about version control(Git) and how to use GitHub. I had to remember how to
position the various aspects of the Order Summary Card using CSS and HTML, which was very fun and interactive. I also learnt how to use git to create a repository and learnt
how to update the repository with the various versions of the code. I also learnt how to push this repository to my GitHub Account. I also learnt how to host my repository project
online.

### Continued development

This challenge has shown me the weaknesses that I have in CSS and HTML. I intend to sharpen up my CSS skills and intend to use Flex Box and Grid so that I can become more
familiar with those methods of positioning items in HTML.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - I had completed the Responsive Web Design Challenge on Freecodecamp but I had not used it in awhile. I revisited these lessons and used them to complete the challenge.
- [Example resource 2](https://w3schools.com) - This is an amazing resource to lookup use cases for code.
